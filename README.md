This is a work in progress


This project seeks to estimate the incumbency advantage in Canadaian federal elections by taking advantage of 10 year redistricting measures.
In short, the voting behaviour of polling stations that are newly added to a riding will be compared to those which are "old" to determine the pure advantage the incumbent enjoys

Presently there are shape files provided which provide geo-coded Lat/long coords for poll stations. poll stations that could not be located, or were placed outside of a given province have been weeded from the data set
